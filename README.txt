Changes made by Ted Ralphs 12/13/13

1. Moved original project files, which are intended to work with code built
from source using the Visual Studio Solution files in Cbc into the directory
BuildFromCourse.

2. Created a directory UseWithInstaller for solution files that work with
libraries installed by the installer for the COIN Optimization Suite.
